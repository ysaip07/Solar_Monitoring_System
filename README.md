# Solar_Monitoring_System

## Working Principle
The working principle of the Solar Monitoring System revolves around continuous real-time monitoring of solar panels' performance and providing the user with actionable insights to 
maintain system efficiency. 

Data Acquisition: The voltage, current, and temperature sensors are attached to the solar panel array. These sensors collect real-time data and send it to the microcontroller. 

Data Processing: The microcontroller processes the received data. It computes values such as power output and efficiency. 

Real-Time Monitoring: The data is displayed on the local display unit, and it is also sent to a cloud-based platform for remote monitoring. 

Alert System: If any parameter falls out of the acceptable range (e.g., voltage exceeds safe limits), the system sends an alert through email, SMS, or a mobile app notification. 

Data Logging: The system stores data for future analysis, which can be used to identify trends or performance anomalies. 
  
Sensor Integration: The voltage, current, and temperature sensors are connected to the microcontroller. These sensors are calibrated and tested before installation. 

Microcontroller Programming: The microcontroller is programmed using Arduino IDE to handle sensor data collection and processing. The program is designed to calculate power output and efficiency. 

Display Interface: An LCD or LED display is connected to the microcontroller to show real-time data. A graphical display can be used to present parameters like power output in bar charts.

Communication Setup: The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is integrated to transmit the data to the cloud for real-time monitoring.
